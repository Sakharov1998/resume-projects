# cool-projects
Hello everyone!
This is my resume and some projects, which I'm going to show.
I'm a junior front-end developer, studying a lot and dreaming of distant working in large IT company. Hope that will be near the seashore :)
Open for discussion and recomendations from colleagues at different levels.
